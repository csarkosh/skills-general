name: doc-artifact
description: Use when the user asks to view, read, open, or share a repository document as a web page or HTML artifact — a spec, plan, research note, or design doc. Renders the markdown as a published Artifact in a dark arctic (Nord) house style. Also use when asked to update or restyle an artifact that was already published from a repository doc. To open a doc locally in Chrome without publishing it, use general:doc-preview instead.

# Repo docs as artifacts

Repository documents are long, structured, and read on screen: a spec with numbered
sections, a plan with phased task lists, a research note with source tables. Read as raw
markdown they are a wall of text. Rendered, their structure does the work.

This skill is the house style for that rendering, so every doc published from a repository
looks like it came from the same place.

## The house style

**Dark arctic, built on [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/).** Nord is literally an arctic
palette, and its greys are blue-biased by construction, so the neutrals already lean
toward the accent rather than reading as unconsidered mid-grey.

| Role | Dark (Polar Night) | Light (Midnight Sun) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ground / surface / raised | `#2E3440` `#3B4252` `#434C5E` | `#ECEFF4` `#E5E9F0` `#DDE3EC` |
| Text primary / body / muted | `#ECEFF4` `#D8DEE9` `#97A3B6` | `#2E3440` `#3B4252` `#5C6879` |
| Accent (Frost) | `#88C0D0` `#5E81AC` `#8FBCBB` | `#4C7FA8` `#3F6591` `#5A8F8E` |
| Status (Aurora) | `#A3BE8C` `#EBCB8B` `#B48EAD` `#BF616A` | `#5C7F45` `#A07D24` `#8A5F84` `#A03B45` |

Dark is the primary world. The light theme is **not a naive inversion** — it is the same
arctic subject at polar day, which is why it gets its own hand-picked Frost and Aurora
values (the dark accents wash out on a light ground).

**Aurora hues carry status, never decoration.** Green ships now, amber is deferred, purple
is specified-but-not-built, red is a stop. If a doc has no status states, it gets no
Aurora — do not sprinkle it for colour.

**Typography.** Do **not** link a webfont: the Artifact CSP blocks font CDNs and the page
will silently fall back. Use deliberate stacks instead, and treat **monospace as a
structural face** — eyebrows, labels, table headers, file paths, function names, metadata.
Monospace is the vernacular of this subject matter, so it carries the identity while the
sans just reads.

```css
--sans: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;
--mono: ui-monospace, "SF Mono", SFMono-Regular, "Cascadia Code", "JetBrains Mono", Menlo, Consolas, monospace;
```

**Layout.** Single column at ~68ch measure, with a sticky section rail on wide screens
(`min-width: 1020px`) that collapses away below it. Tables, code blocks and diagrams each
get their own `overflow-x: auto` container so the body never scrolls sideways.

**One flourish, and only one:** a 3px aurora gradient band across the very top. No hero.
These are documents.

## Treatment

These are utilitarian documents, not landing pages. Polished — real hierarchy, considered
spacing, a proper palette — but restrained. No giant hero, no scroll animation, no
decorative iconography.

**Structure must encode something true.** A spec's §-numbers, or a deploy or release
process's genuinely ordered phases, are honest to number. A flat list of considerations is
not a sequence — do not number it just to have numbers.

## How to build one

1. **Read the source document in full.** Render its real content — never summarise it into
   bullets and never invent sections it does not have.
2. **Find its structure.** Numbered sections become the rail and the section headers.
   Repeated `key: value` prose becomes a table. Status words like "deferred", "shipped",
   "not built" become chips. Ordered pipelines become numbered stages.
3. **Pull the warnings out.** Anything the doc flags as a trap, a gap, or a thing that has
   already gone wrong becomes a callout — those are the highest-value lines in the file and
   they get lost in prose.
4. **Write the page**, then publish with the `Artifact` tool.

Write the file to the scratchpad directory, not into the repo — published artifacts are
build output, and the markdown remains the source of truth.

### Required mechanics

- Content only: no `<!doctype>`, `<html>`, `<head>` or `<body>` tags. A `<title>` and a
  `<style>` block at the top of the content are correct and work.
- Theme through **tokens**: define on `:root`, redefine under
  `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark|light)`, then redefine again under
  `:root[data-theme="dark"]` and `:root[data-theme="light"]` so the viewer's toggle wins in
  both directions. Style components through tokens only — never inside the media query.
- `text-wrap: balance` on headings, `text-wrap: pretty` on body copy.
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` anywhere digits align in a column.
- Visible `:focus-visible` outlines; a `prefers-reduced-motion` block.
- Everything inlined. No CDN, no remote font, no remote image — the CSP blocks all of it.
- Pass a `favicon` (🧊 fits the arctic house style) and keep it stable across redeploys.

### Updating an existing artifact

Republishing **the same file path in the same conversation** keeps the URL. From a fresh
conversation, find it with `Artifact` `action: "list"` and pass its URL as `url`, or a new
URL gets minted.

## Anti-patterns

| Don't | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Link Tailwind, Bootstrap, or Google Fonts | The CSP blocks external hosts. It fails silently and the page renders unstyled |
| Invert the dark palette to make the light theme | Frost accents wash out on a light ground. Pick light values deliberately |
| Add Aurora colour to a doc with no status states | Colour then means nothing, which is worse than no colour |
| Number a list that is not a sequence | Numbering claims an order the content does not have |
| Summarise the doc | The point is to read the document, rendered. Summarising loses exactly the detail someone opened it for |
| Commit the HTML to the repo | The markdown is the source of truth; the artifact is build output. Scratchpad only |
